_1. Parsing_

Before we can execute code entered into the interpreter, we will need to parse
the expression given. This is done in a series of stages, using a set of
static functions:

split the string into 'raw' tokens, (4) divide these tokens into 'syntax'
tokens, and finally (5) evaluating the expression within the interpreter
environment.

### Trimmed Expression

### Raw Tokens

Raw tokens lists are an intermediary structure generated by the
RawTokenSplitter object. These are created when splitting a
